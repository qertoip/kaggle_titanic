Kaggle Titanic
==============

This is my very quick attempt at solving Titanic challenge at Kaggle.
My goal here was to get reasonable score in under one hour,
so little effort went toward feature engineering.

It has 0.77 external accuracy on Kaggle.

It has 0.82 internal mean CV accuracy.
The 5-fold CV over training set itself has very little 0.0000195 variance,
suggesting no major overfitting.

The Titanic task is known for large discrepancy in patterns between (public) training data and (secret) test data.
